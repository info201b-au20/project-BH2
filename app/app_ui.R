      the mean temperature over time, resulting in dry land that burns easily and that heat waves happen more frequently
      and for longer. We also learned that a decrease in rain can result in droughts, also a 
      driver of wildfires. We hypothesized that the increase in wildfires and wildfire intensity (measured in brightness) was 
      the result of these factors, which are in turn the result of the climate changing.
      After creating our graphs, we reached three major conclusions, which support our hypothesis and hopefully relay the severity of

Climate change remains one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century. Australia, 
an already deeply arid and dry country with a lot of land dedicated to agricultural pursuits, is especially at risk
for the adverse impacts of climate change. 2018 was a year marked by the longest period of drought Australia has ever seen and the beginning of 2020 saw 
months on-end of devastating bushfires all over Australia, which displaced and killed people and decimated flora and fauna. 
The rising temperatures and changes in mean rainfall over time are the results of climate change, as are fires with more intense light and brightness which indicates
that the fires are growing hotter. When we started this project, our group decided to look at various
measures of climate change in Australia, both in 2020 and over the last 70 years, to examine how important measures of climate change (brightness, mean temperature, mean rainfall)
are changing in major cities across Australia. We believe that examining these measures and calling attention to the potential devastation climate change could cause is necessary
to shape coherent policy and invest in harm reduction strategies. For this project, we used two major datasets. Our first datase that compiled multiple sources 
ranging from NASA to the Australian Government. We downloaded the dataset from the tidy Tuesday dataset sourced from NASA and the New South Wales Rural Fire Service courtesy of Dean Marchiori.Our second dataset 
was constructed using values from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology, which has historic data on rainfall and temperature change over time all over Australia.
Both datasets helped us shape a project we believe is both meaningful and necessary in addressing and combating climate change in Australia.
